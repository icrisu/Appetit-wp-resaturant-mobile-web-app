# Appetit
Appetit is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily create a mobile web app for your restaurant and much more. You can print the generated QR image code and place it on the tables, when people will scan the code, they will be directed to the mobile web app where they can view the menu and select what they want before the waiter comes to that table.
